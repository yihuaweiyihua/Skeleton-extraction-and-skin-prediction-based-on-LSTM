* 2021.3.31 : We try to add simple position embedding in each self-attention layer, we get a more stable training process and 93.3% (5 run best) accuracy on modelnet40 dataset. Code updates in classification network.
* 2021.3.29 : PCT has been accepted by Computational Visual Media Journal (CVMJ).


## Astract


The irregular domain and lack of ordering make it challenging to design deep neural networks for point cloud processing. This paper presents a novel framework named Point Cloud Transformer(PCT) for point cloud learning. PCT is based on Transformer, which achieves huge success in natural language processing and displays great potential in image processing. It is inherently permutation invariant for processing a sequence of points, making it well-suited for point cloud learning. To better capture local context within the point cloud, we enhance input embedding with the support of farthest point sampling and nearest neighbor search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the PCT achieves the state-of-the-art performance on shape classification, part segmentation and normal estimation tasks
